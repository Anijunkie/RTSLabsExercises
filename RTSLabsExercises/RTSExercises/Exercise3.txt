#3  If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?

	There are a great many things python does very well but if I had to pick one thing about it that I could change, it would be changing from being a dynamically typed language to a statically typed language. While having variables be dynamically typed allows for more flexibility in writing code (especially if variable types are unknown), the trade off is the risk of significantly more bugs at runtime in comparison to statically typed languages. Making python a statically typed language reduces confusion in how the code is written as well as clarifies variable types in code reviews, thus allowing a better grasp in what and how everything in a program interacts with each other.
